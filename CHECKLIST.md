### Changelog for 1.0.0
Name: The actually major update
# File list
The file list has seen major improvements, now having a table-like layout.
# Images tab
Major improvements are made to the images tab, allowing you to preview the images within the application
The images will appear in a grid-like interface just like any file manager.
# Translations
Thanks to @MarcelDev and @Vonercecnt for keeping translations up to date
# Minor changes
You can now right-click on assets to see the properties, because of this, a setting has been added to remove the toolbar

You can now copy to other assets from one asset instead of swapping them

Version numbers now follow major.minor.patch

The option to refresh before extracting all assets can be enabled to make sure you get the latest assets extracted

The search is now case-insensitive.

Leaving the box blank for asset name edit blank will fill in with the original name as the placeholder text. This is to make it more obvious on how to remove custom names from assets.

You can now test development builds within the settings
