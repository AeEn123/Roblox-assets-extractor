### Changelog for 1.0.0
Name: The actually major update
# Images tab
Major improvements are made to the images tab, allowing you to preview the images within the application
The images will appear in a grid-like interface just like any file manager.
# Rebrand
The project was renamed to RoExtract to avoid any trademark concerns. RoExtract is **NOT** affiliated with the Roblox Corporation in any way.
# Translations
Thanks to @MarcelDev and @Vonercent for keeping translations up-to-date.
# Minor changes
The program can now read from the SQL database that the roblox client stores assets in instead of the http folder, both are still supported.

You can now right-click on assets to see the properties, because of this, a setting has been added to remove the toolbar. The toolbar will not be removed, it is up to user-preference.

You can now copy to other assets from one asset instead of swapping them.

Version numbers now follow major.minor.patch

The option to refresh before extracting all assets can be enabled to make sure you get the latest assets extracted

The search is now case-insensitive.

Leaving the box blank for asset name edit blank will fill in with the original name as the placeholder text. This is to make it more obvious on how to remove custom names from assets.

You can now test development builds within the settings

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AeEn123/RoExtract/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1

## 1.1.0
- [ ] - Fallback to an egui-based dialog (e.g. via a compatible crate) when native_dialog is unavailable/missing-dep (e.g. headless or systems without zenity/kdialog). Currently `sql_database.rs` `.unwrap()`s the native_dialog result, which panics and aborts the entire `refresh` scan when no SQL database is detected without a fallback UI.
- [ ] - Rewrite in listing - independent lists for each type
- [ ] - Split cache_directory.rs into two files
- [ ] - Hande file list filtering in file_list.rs instead
- [ ] - Built-in media player to quickly preview sounds
- [ ] - Ability to convert between formats
- [ ] - Audio length in list
- [ ] - Make it into a table with specific details e.g size, type, time created
- [ ] - Wait for translations

## Future releases
- [ ] - Roblox mesh extraction and conversion
- [ ] - Font extraction
- [ ] - Video extraction
- [ ] - Finish CLI mode documentation
- [ ] - Community-made resource packs
- [ ] - Automatic command line generation for [Bloxstrap](https://github.com/pizzaboxer/bloxstrap)
- [ ] - Docs available in different languages
